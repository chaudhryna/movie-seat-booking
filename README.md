# movie-seat-booking

A movie seat booking project built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

// ToDo in future

Right now if the user selects another movie from the dropdown list the seats remain the same.  The price changes but the seats should also change. They are saved in localStorage but not changing when the selected movie changes.
